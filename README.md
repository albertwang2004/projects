# projects
Personal and past school projects, competitive programming, etc.

Minesweeper/ contains a C++ rendition of Minesweeper as a programming project from COP3503 - Programming Fundamentals 2. Opening the .cbp project in Code::Blocks probably needs additional setup with the SFML libraries, but for actually playing the game Minesweeper.exe should work just fine on its own

Codeforces/ is a compilation of a few hundred submissions to various problems on Codeforces. Due to the nature of competitive programming, this code is not the most readable or stylistically correct since all of it is written extremely quickly in a time crunch, and also relies on pasting in the various templates found under ./algo/all.cpp, which is basically a big text file that barely deserves to be .cpp at the moment.

Naming convention - a folder named "PS" followed by a number contains my submissions to the problem set/contest with that numerical ID.
